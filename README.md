## Reflection:
This term our game is called Hornets HFD. It is set in the near future where ann explosion of brush fires is wreaking havoc in our community. Fires are spontaneously 
erupting all over campus and you are tasked with using your firefighting helicopters to extinguish all of the fires and save the campus. The goal of this project was to develop a simple but fully playable version
 of thte game and to introduce the concept of programming in Codename One. This project is build using OOP and OOD, and on top of that is to recognize some of the faults of in early class 
 structure and make use of inheritance to improve code reuse and to avoid violating the DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
